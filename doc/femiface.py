In general, an external modeling code sets up a set of non-linear
equations,

h_i(x,theta) = 0, for i=1,...,m

that must be satisfied in order to ensure the underlying physics of a
particular system of interest.

In this system of equations, x is an n-dimensional vector (typicall, of 
nodal displacements?), and theta is a d-dimensional parameter vector. 
In many cases m=n, and the system of equations uniquely determines a
solution for x given any fixed (plausible) vector of parameters.

The goal is to use linear tangent adjoint methods to efficiently 
estimate  the optimal parameters required to match the solution to 
experimentally measured data, and to quantify the uncertainty in the
estimate.

The basic approach relies on first solving the above system at an
initial guess for the parameter vector. This will yield a plausible 
initial displacement solution vector x_0. Then the linear 
approximation

h(x,theta) =~ h(x_0, theta) + D_x(theta) (x - x_0),

is formed with respect to the initial displacement solution, and where 
D_x(theta) is the m x n Jacobian of h with respect to (w.r.t.) x, 
evaluated at x_0.  This approximation can be non-linear with respect 
to theta.

To simplify notation, let 

b(theta) = D_x x_0 - h(x_0, theta), 

and 

A(theta) = D_x,

so that the approximation to our original set of non-linear equations 
becomes

A(theta) x = b(theta).

Of course, if h(x, theta) is linear w.r.t. x to begin with then there's
no approximation required for this step.

This choice of notation, aligns with the notation used to formulate 
general optimization problems.
